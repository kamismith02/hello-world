# Overview

This project is a simple "Hello World" program aimed at strengthening my understanding of basic coding practices and working with version control on GitHub. The goal of this project is to create a foundational piece of software and demonstrate my ability to set up, run, and document a program in a familiar language.

The purpose of creating this software is to solidify my knowledge in setting up a simple project, writing and running code, and sharing it publicly. By completing this project, I'm gaining hands-on experience with essential programming and documentation skills.
